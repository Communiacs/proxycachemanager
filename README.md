TYPO3 Extension: proxycachemanager
==================================

A flexible and generic way to track the pages that are cached by a reverse proxy like nginx or varnish, or any
classic CDN.

What does it do?
----------------
By embracing TYPO3's Caching Framework this extension provides a new cache to track all pages outputted that are
"cacheable". When an editor changes content on a page, the page cache needs to be cleared - and the CDN / reverse proxy
needs to be informed that the cache is invalid. This is usually done via a HTTP PURGE request to the CDN / proxy server.

The benefits for that are that the editor does not need to worry why out-of-date information is still visible
on his/her website.

Requirements
------------
 * A TYPO3 setup (7 LTS+) with cacheable content, see the "cacheinfo" extension for what can be tracked with HTTP caches.
 * Either nginx or varnish configured to proxy the TYPO3 system. For nginx, make sure that nginx is compiled to allow to flush caches via HTTP PURGE (see #### for more information).

Setup
-----
Install the extension and make sure to enter the detail about your proxy servers, otherwise the default (IENV:TYPO3_REV_PROXY) is used.

Don't forget to set the according TYPO3 settings for using proxies, see $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['reverseProxyIP'] and $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['reverseProxyHeaderMultiValue'].

Whenever a cacheable frontend page is now called, the full URL is stored in a cache called "tx_proxy" automatically (a derivative of the Typo3DatabaseBackend cache), tagged with the pageID. Whenever the cache is flushed, the database table is emptied completely, additionally, a HTTP PURGE call to the reverse proxy is made to empty all caches. If only a certain tag is removed, the PURGE call is made only to the relevant URLs that are stored in the cache.

The extension was created taken all the great from Andreas Gellhaus, Tom RÃ¼ther into account, as well as moc_varnish and cacheinfo as great work before.
