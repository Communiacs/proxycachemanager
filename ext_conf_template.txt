# cat=proxy; type=options[Varnish via Curl/HTTP=B13_Proxycachemanager_Provider_VarnishHttpProxyProvider,Nginx via Curl/HTTP=B13_Proxycachemanager_Provider_CurlHttpProxyProvider]; label=Choose the reverse proxy:Select the proxy in use and its provider to connect to the provider
reverseProxyProvider = B13_Proxycachemanager_Provider_VarnishHttpProxyProvider

# cat=proxy; label=Define the IP/hostname of the reverse proxy:Use multiple hosts as a comma-separated list, also, you can use these variables ({scheme}, {host}, {port}, {user}, {pass}, {path}, {query}, {fragment}, {url}) to make PURGE calls dynamically. Useful for nginx. Usually http://127.0.0.1:8023/{path} should do the trick
reverseProxyEndpoints = http://{host}/purge/{path}
